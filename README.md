# vercel-cljs

_This project is under construction._

## Goal

Making shipping serverless Clojure(Script) applications
on the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) platform
as easy as [shipping JavaScript, Go, Python, and Ruby today](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages).

The second goal is to help developers transition from JavaScript to Clojure.
